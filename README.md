# This repository displays my code for my science project where I inputted dust values collected from a dust sensor into a epidemiological model to predict Valley Fever Cases
# The model utilizes differential equations and is based off the "SIR Model" commonly used in epidemiology
# In "Dust Sensor Code.py", copy and paste this code into [make.](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor and aquire an Octopus Dust Sensor (https://www.elecfreaks.com/learn-en/microbitOctopus/sensor/octopus_ef11083.html)
# You will need to install odeint from scripy.integrate, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and csv
#
#
# Install by copy and pasting the following command in your terminal:
# pip install scipy matplotlib numpy csv
#
# Other than that, you will not need any other imports as I only utilize python
# Check out the code for yourself!
